Visualizing environmental NGO membership over time
Project Designers: Jasmine Vazin and Molly Williams

Our app will visualize environmental NGO membership over time by zip code and/or congressional district. Bren researchers have explored how membership in these interest groups can offer a potential measure of what drives political mobilization. This app could be used to map regions where environmental policy or action is more likely to occur, or for related political issues linked to support of environmentalism.
